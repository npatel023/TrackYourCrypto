# Track your crypto project

## Description

I wanted to gain experience using Node JS with Express and MongoDB for the backend
so I decided to create a dashboard personalized for individual users. This has been 
done by many but I really wanted to put my own twist on this and share it with others.

Users can sign up and choose what coins they want to keep track of.
Users will be provided a dashboard of the coins they choose with information of the coin's price, and the coin's percent change in last hour, 24 hours, and 7 days. 

I am using the coinmarketcap api to collect the coin data.


| Frontend   | Backend |
|:-----------:| :--------:|
|   *HTML*    | *Node.js* |
|   *CSS*     | *Express* |
|*Bootstrap*  | *MongoDB* |
|*JavaScript* | *Mongoose* |


My goal after this project is to learn a frontend framework which is either React/Redux, Vue.js, or Angular.
